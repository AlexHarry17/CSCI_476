I) The probability that Eve would succeed is (n/(2^20)), or (n/1048576). This means that if n = 2^20 (the total number of possible		-- CHECK WITH BIRTHDAY PARADOX FORMULA, THIS MAY BE WRONG
ID numbers), then she would have 100% chance of success due to the Pigeon-hole Principle.

II) For the probability to be at least 0.5, the value of n should be at least 1207 according to the Birthday Paradox.					-- ALSO MAY BE WRONG

III) Yes; the pseudo-random number generator would simply need a way to not repeat numbers generated. One way to do this
would be to keep a list of generated numbers and if one was repeated just generate a new one until it is unique. However, 
this would be very time consuming even for a computer. A better way to do it would be to build an array of length n where
n is the number of random numbers the user wants generated, populate the array with numbers corresponding to their position 
in the array, and shuffle all the numbers around randomly. This would prevent collisions and guarantee a success for these
query IDs in at most 2^20 tries. 

IV) The smallest m that Eve could succeed with a probability of at least 0.5 would be
