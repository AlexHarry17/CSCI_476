I) The probability that Eve would succeed is calculated with the formula 1 - ((2^20)! / (((2^20)^n) * ((2^20) - n)!)), 
since the ID is a 20-bit number and bits can either be of the value 0 or 1.

II) For the probability to be at least 0.5, the value of n should be at 

III) Yes; the pseudo-random number generator would simply need a way to not repeat numbers generated. One way to do this
would be to keep a list of generated numbers and if one was repeated just generate a new one until it is unique. However, 
this would be very time consuming even for a computer. A better way to do it would be to build an array of length n where
n is the number of random numbers the user wants generated, populate the array with numbers corresponding to their position 
in the array, and shuffle all the numbers around randomly. This would prevent collisions and guarantee a success for these
query IDs in at most 2^20 tries. 

IV) The smallest m that Eve could succeed with a probability of at least 0.5 would be
